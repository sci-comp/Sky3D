## Status:
> 1.0.1
------------------------------------

## Reflections:
> Optimal reflections are possible with a well-configured reflection probe. 
------------------------------------

## Pull Request:
> Currently I do not accept pull request.
------------------------------------

## Limitations: 
- You can only get reflections with a reflection probe.
- The reflection probe can produce artifacts if the intensity of the sun is very high. 
- The sky model and clouds does not have support for altitude variation. 

## Future:
- Currently it is experimental, for godot 4 I will improve the design and the plugin in general. 

## Feedback is welcome.

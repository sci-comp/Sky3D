## Installation

* Clone or download the repository. 
* Open the project in Godot and run `demo/Sky3DDemo.tscn` to test it.
* Copy `addons/sky_3d` into your project `addons` directory. Create the folder if missing.
* Open `Project -> Project Settings -> Plugins` and enable the plugin. 


## Usage

* Create or open a Scene.
* Remove any existing `WorldEnvironment` node.
* Create a new `Sky3D` node.
* Customize the settings of the `Sky3D`, `Sky3D/Environment`, `TimeOfDay`, `Skydome`, `SunLight`, and `MoonLight` nodes. Some settings like light energy, color, and angle are driven by Sky3D and not changeable unless you disable `Sky3D.enable_editor_time` and/or `enable_game_time`. Other settings like shadow configuration are adjustable.
